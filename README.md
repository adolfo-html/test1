Markdown is a plain-text file format. .md files just indicate that the text in the file is in markdown syntax. Cool

## Ok markdown is kinda neat

I heard you should keep a blank line between the headers and paragraphs, just as good practice.
<p>You can have paragraph tags like in HTML here too huh!!!! How do you make comments in an .md file?</p>
